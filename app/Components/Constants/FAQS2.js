        question: "What is the cost of a hair transplant?",
        answer: "The cost of a hair transplant varies depending on the extent of hair loss, the number of grafts needed, and the technique used. During your consultation, we'll provide a detailed quote tailored to your specific needs. We also offer flexible payment plans to make the procedure more accessible."

    {
        question: "How long is the recovery time?",
        answer: "Most patients can return to work within 2-3 days after the procedure. The initial healing phase takes about 7-10 days, during which you may experience some redness and scabbing. Full recovery and hair growth typically occurs over 6-12 months as the transplanted follicles settle and begin producing new hair."
    },
    {
        question: "Are hair transplant permanent?",
        answer: "Yes, hair transplants are considered a permanent solution. The transplanted hair follicles are taken from areas resistant to balding (typically the back and sides of the head) and maintain their characteristics even after transplantation. These hairs will continue to grow naturally for a lifetime."
    },
    {
        question: "Will the procedure scars?",
        answer: "Modern hair transplant techniques like FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction) leave minimal scarring. FUE creates tiny dot-like scars that are virtually undetectable, even with short hairstyles. The FUT method may leave a linear scar, but it's typically well-hidden by surrounding hair. Our skilled surgeons use advanced techniques to minimize any visible scarring."
